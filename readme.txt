# Simple Electron Template App

If your using this you should have a basic understanding of web dev and app dev and should also know how to use 
electron, as it is very easy.

Im not gonna tell you how to do much as like I already said you should know all of this.

# Information

This is just a simple starter template for those who dont want to make all the files yourself. Ofc your welcomed to rename all the files and change the paths names packages and so on. This project uses electron framework and also uses "nodemon" script as well for autoloading the app, you can edit the nodemon.json to pick and choose what you want to be auto reloaded after saved and what you dont. If you look in the nodemon.json the "Ignore" Will obv ignore those file types and the "ext" will do the oppsite of that. This project uses the latest version of electron which at the time of creation is 27.0.4 and nodemon version is 3.0.1, I may continue to update these as i see necessary. All node_modules and packages come installed with this project. Also note to mention this project does not use electrons auto updater of any kind.

# How To

To run the basic electron app open the terminal in visual studio code and use "npm start".

To run the auto loader use "npm run watch".
To restart the auto loader app just type "rs" in the terminal.
